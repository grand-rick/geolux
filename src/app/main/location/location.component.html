      geographical characteristics include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Location and Accessibility</strong>
        - Proximity to Nairobi: Ruiru's closeness to Nairobi makes it a
        significant suburban area with easy access to the capital via the Thika
        Superhighway and the Nairobi Eastern Bypass. This connectivity has
        spurred residential and industrial growth. - Coordinates: The town is
        situated at approximately 1.1601° S latitude and 36.9613° E longitude.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Topography</strong> <br />
        Elevation: Ruiru lies at an elevation of about 1,562 meters (5,125 feet)
        above sea level. This elevation contributes to its moderate climate,
        which is typical of the Central Kenyan highlands. - Terrain: The
        landscape around Ruiru is generally flat to gently rolling, suitable for
        both agriculture and urban development.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Climate</strong> <br />
        - Temperature: The climate is temperate with average temperatures
        ranging from 12°C (54°F) to 26°C (79°F). The area enjoys a generally
        pleasant climate, with cooler temperatures compared to the coastal
        regions of Kenya. - Rainfall: Ruiru receives bimodal rainfall, with the
        long rains occurring from March to May and the short rains from October
        to December. Annual precipitation averages around 1,000 to 1,200
        millimeters (39 to 47 inches).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hydrology</strong> <br />
        - Rivers and Streams: The town is traversed by several small rivers and
        streams, including the Ruiru River, which flows into the larger Athi
        River. These water bodies are crucial for local agriculture and also
        supply water to the Nairobi metropolis. - Water Resources: The presence
        of rivers and a relatively high water table support both agriculture and
        residential needs, though increasing urbanization has put pressure on
        these resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vegetation and Land Use</strong>
        - Flora: Historically, the area around Ruiru was covered by forests and
        grasslands, but much of this has been cleared for agriculture and urban
        development. Some patches of indigenous trees and shrubs can still be
        found. - Agriculture: The fertile soils of Ruiru support diverse
        agricultural activities, including coffee plantations, horticulture, and
        subsistence farming. Coffee farming has traditionally been significant
        but has been declining due to urbanization. - Urbanization: Rapid urban
        expansion has led to a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial
        land uses. Housing estates, factories, and commercial centers are
        increasingly prominent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Socio-Economic Geography</strong>
        - Industrial Hub: Ruiru is a growing industrial hub, hosting numerous
        factories and manufacturing plants due to its strategic location near
        Nairobi and along major transportation routes. - Residential
        Development: The town has seen a surge in residential developments,
        including gated communities and apartment complexes, catering to
        Nairobi's growing commuter population.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      <strong>
        In summary, Ruiru's geographical characteristics of a strategic
        location, temperate climate, fertile soils, and hydrological features
        make it an attractive area for both residential and industrial
        development. The ongoing urbanization continues to shape its landscape,
        transitioning from an agricultural to a more urbanized setting.
