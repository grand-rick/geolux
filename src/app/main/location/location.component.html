    <p>
      East Charleston Park, located in Las Vegas, Nevada, is situated within the
      Mojave Desert, a region characterized by its arid climate and distinctive
      desert landscape. Here’s a brief overview of the geographical features
      around East Charleston Park:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Desert Terrain: The area is dominated by typical desert terrain,
        including sandy soils and sparse vegetation. The vegetation primarily
        consists of hardy, drought-resistant plants such as cacti, creosote
        bushes, and Joshua trees.
      </li>
      <li>
        Climate: The region experiences a desert climate, characterized by hot
        summers, mild winters, and very low annual precipitation. Temperatures
        in the summer can exceed 100°F (38°C), while winter temperatures are
        more moderate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Topography: The land is relatively flat with some undulating hills and
        small mountains in the surrounding areas. The nearby Red Rock Canyon to
        the west features striking red sandstone peaks and cliffs, offering a
        stark contrast to the otherwise flat desert landscape.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hydrology: Water bodies are scarce due to the arid conditions. However,
        ephemeral streams may flow during rare rain events, and there are a few
        man-made water features and retention basins designed to manage the
        occasional rainfall.
      </li>
      <li>
        Urban Development: East Charleston Park is within an urbanized area of
        Las Vegas, surrounded by residential neighborhoods, commercial areas,
        and infrastructure. The park itself provides green space and
        recreational areas for the community amidst the urban environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Proximity to Natural Features: Despite its urban setting, the park is
        relatively close to several natural attractions. Red Rock Canyon
        National Conservation Area is nearby, offering hiking, rock climbing,
        and scenic drives. The Spring Mountains to the west provide additional
        outdoor recreational opportunities.
      </li>
    </ul>
